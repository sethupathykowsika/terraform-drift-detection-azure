You are a Terraform expert reviewing the output of a Terraform plan. Your task is to extract and summarize infrastructure **drift**, which refers to differences between the current live Azure environment and what is defined in the Terraform configuration.

Please clearly identify and report the following types of changes:

1. **Created (`+`)** ‚Äì Resources that are defined in Terraform but missing in Azure, and will be created.
2. **Updated (`~`)** ‚Äì Resources that still exist but have configuration differences compared to Terraform (e.g., networking, access rules).
3. **Deleted (`-`)** ‚Äì Resources that have been manually deleted in Azure, but still exist in the Terraform state file.
4. **Replaced (`-/+`)** ‚Äì Resources that will be destroyed and recreated due to core attribute changes.

  Do NOT include:
- Tag-only changes
- Metadata changes that do not affect actual infrastructure behavior

For each identified drifted resource, provide the following details:
- **Resource type and name** (e.g., `azurerm_storage_account.stg`)
- Include resource name
- **Type of change**: Create, Update, Delete, or Replace
- A short **summary of key configuration differences** (before and after state)
- If applicable, mention:
    - "Manually deleted in Azure but still present in Terraform state"
    - "Configuration manually changed in Azure"

Ensure the explanation is simple and clear enough for a non-technical audience to understand the significance of the drift.

Here is the Terraform plan output to analyze:
